Based on the project structure and the features you've described, here are the next steps I'd recommend:
- Set up Prisma:
Initialize Prisma in your project and create your database schema.

- Create database schema:
Edit the prisma/schema.prisma file to define your data models (e.g., User, Subscription, Invoice, Payment, Expense).

- Set up authentication:
Configure NextAuth for user authentication. Create an app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts file to set up your authentication providers.

- Create API routes:
Start creating API routes in the app/api directory for various functionalities like subscription management, invoice generation, payment processing, etc.

- Implement Stripe integration:
Set up Stripe for payment processing. Create necessary API routes and client-side components for handling payments.

- Create main pages:
Begin creating the main pages of your application in the app directory, such as:
    - Dashboard
    - Subscriptions
    - Invoices
    - Payments
    - Expenses
    - Reports   

- Implement components:
Create reusable components for common UI elements like forms, tables, charts, etc.

- Set up state management:
Consider using a state management solution like React Context or Redux for managing global state.

- Implement data fetching:
Use React Query or SWR for efficient data fetching and caching.

- Style your application:
Utilize Tailwind CSS to style your components and pages.

- Set up testing:
Implement unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

- Configure environment variables:
Set up environment variables for sensitive information like API keys.
To get started, let's focus on setting up Prisma and creating the initial database schema.
